# LaTeX For Humans \(with a Mac\)

This is an attempt to create a practical, human readable tutorial for LaTeX. For now it is humans with a Mac only.

1. **\(Work in progress, 40% done\)** The Emergency Chapter: You have written a paper that needs to be formatted to some journal or conference standard and the submission deadline is tonight. This assumes that you have been provided template files by your journal or conference.   
2. **\(Planned\)** How to Write a Thesis: You need to write a longer text like a book or thesis. A nerd person you know has informed you that you "should write it in LaTeX". You have heard multiple horror stories of graduate students chasing images through a 150 page Word document while the program keeps crashing. These students were never seen again. The nerd person rolls eyes when you even mention Word. You think it might make sense, especially with the missing students, but the information you find on LaTeX makes you want to book a one-way flight to Mars. This is not your fault, by the way.
3. Where to get help. A curated list of resources if you have more questions.
