# LaTeX For Humans \(with Macs\)

This is an attempt to create a human readable tutorial for using LaTeX. For now it is humans with Macs only.

Read it on Gitbook: [https://crcdng.gitbooks.io/latex-for-humans/content/](https://crcdng.gitbooks.io/latex-for-humans/content/)

**Work in progress.** Planned content:

1. The Emergency Chapter: You have written a paper that needs to be formatted to some journal or conference standard and the submission deadline is tonight.    
2. How to Write a Thesis: You need to write a longer text like a book or thesis. A nerd person you know has informed you that you "should write it in LaTeX". You have heard multiple horror stories of graduate students chasing images through a 150 page Word document while the program keeps crashing. The students were never seen again. The nerd person rolls eyes. You think it makes sense but the information you found on LaTeX makes you want to book a one-way flight to Mars. This is not your fault.
