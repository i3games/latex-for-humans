LaTeX For Humans \(with a Mac\)

This is an attempt to create a practical and human readable tutorial for LaTeX. For now it is for humans with a Mac only.

1. **\(Work in progress, 67% done\)** The Emergency Chapter: You have written a paper that needs to be formatted to some journal or conference standard and the submission deadline is tonight. This also assumes that your journal or conference has provided you with template files.

2. **\(Planned\)** How to Write a Thesis: You need to write a longer text like a book or thesis. A nerd person you know has informed you that you "absolutely should write it in LaTeX". You also have heard multiple horror stories of graduate students chasing images through a 150 page Word document while the program keeps crashing. These students were never seen again. The nerd person rolls eyes when you even mention Word. You think it might make sense, especially with the missing students, but the information you find on LaTeX makes you want to book a one-way flight to Mars. This is not your fault, by the way.

   This chapter goes through two alternative setups: one that allows you to write your text in Word, which builds on the scenario in chapter 1, just that you are writing a thesis instead of a paper. This requires some additional constructs, like a table of contents, and more time \(I hope you don't plan to format your your thesis in the night before submission\). The second scenario will go through writing your thesis in Markdown and compile to LaTeX, which is what I do and what the nerd person would totally approve. Pros and cons of both approaches will be discussed so you can make an informed decision.

3. **\(Planned\)** Where to get help. A curated list of resources if you have more questions.
