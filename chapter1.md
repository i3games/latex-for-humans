# The Emergency Chapter

Picture yourself: You have to submit a paper to this conference and the deadline is **tonight**. Yes, you had two months time, but for some reason creativity only kicked in last minute. You finally managed to write your thing but now it comes down to "please provide a camera ready version" / "please format in HUMBLEMUMBLE style". Clock is ticking[^2] [^4].

## Pest vs. Cholera

What usually happens is that you get a choice between Microsoft Word and LaTeX. You also get a link to download templates and example files to work with. What you see might look like this:![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-04-13 at 14.23.14.png)

The choice is obvious: they have given you **one** Word template versus **seven** strange files. You dont event want to know what these things are. Also it is likely that have written your masterpiece in Word already[^1]. So the sensible thing to do is to open the Word file and copy/paste your content over piece by piece, heading by heading, paragraph by paragrapgh. Sure there are pesky things like foootnotes, tables and images. And the citations and reference list have to be formatted in a certain style. Still easy enough, just keep calm and copy/paste. You start... until something happens.

You have just copied some piece of text when you realize the whole paragraph now looks like the heading. You try to undo it and try again. Some text still looks strange. You look into the formats but there are 35 of them, labelled "standard", "default text" and "paragraph". Which one? You delete the example image and copy your image in, but is too large and now it is half on the bottom of page 3 and half outside the page. Also the footnotes are suddenly gone. Attempts to fix this result in more chaos. Some text is behind the picture, and trying to delete the table in the example that you don't need also deletes some text on another page. 

By now your paper looks like this[^3]: 

![](/assets/Pablo_Picasso,_1911,_The_Poet_%28Le_poète%29,_Céret,_oil_on_linen,_131.2_×_89.5_cm,_The_Solomon_R._Guggenheim_Foundation,_Peggy_Guggenheim_Collection,_Venice.jpg)

This is beyound repair. Maybe a short glance to the other alternative. You google "LaTeX" and the results does not look promising. Everything you read is technical and confusing and seems to have been written by greybeards educating you about obscure typesetting practices, celebrating themselves that you can use Umlauts like it's 1999. They assume that you want to spend months learning their noble craft and join their typesetting guild in addition to being an overworked student. That won't work.  

So you decide to start over with a fresh copy of the Word template. Two hours later the second one looks like the first. You are chasing your image through the text. Stuff appears and disappears at random. You also realize that you will have to change the appearence and order of the references one by one. And it's only five pages! Suddenly a shrill alarm sound. Midnight! **Game over**. 

## How to do it

[^1]: I am working with a number of assumptions here that might or might not be working for you. 

[^2]: Some conferences or journals have friendly editors that accept your half-formatted contribution by e-mail but some have automated systems that SHUT. DOWN. AT. MIDNIGHT.
